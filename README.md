# Handwriting recognition and Medical chatbot
This repository provides a thorough summary of my contributions to Noora Health. Utilizing Google's Gemini ProVision and DocumentAI technologies, I developed strong methods to pull tabular data from various images of paper documents. Furthermore, I led the creation of a RAG model that can effectively answer user questions in various languages, with the help of an advanced translation interface.
